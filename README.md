panoramagram
============
Develop a program based on face-detection to simplify reading panorama. The algorithm detects up to 6 faces in the frame and selected the biggest face as the object. While the head moves toward right, the panorama would come to the right part in proportion. It works the same in the contrast direction. Also, when the head moves toward the screen, the panorama will be amplified. With this program, the articulation and size could be realized at the same time.
